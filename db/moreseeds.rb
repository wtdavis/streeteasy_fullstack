        description: "Welcome to The Rheingold, the new standard of luxury living in Bushwick. No longer riding the coattails of its neighbors to the north and west, The Rheingold puts Bushwick on the map with a luxurious, resort-style building. Occupying a full square block, on the site of the former Rheingold Brewery, the building features 500 units spread out on eight floors.
        
        The apartments were designed to maximize living space and provide the latest in comfort, design and technology. Large windows and open interiors allow for bright and cheerful layouts. Units are equipped with efficient cooling/heating systems, built-in Bluetooth speakers and video intercom. Finished with wide-plank white oak flooring, designer tiles, high ceilings and ample closet space, the wide variety of floor plans means that there are options for everyone. Most units feature private outdoor space. Kitchens feature stainless steel appliances, soft-close glass cabinetry and sparkling porcelain backsplashes. The bathrooms are outfitted with deep-soaking tubs, sleek chrome fittings, beautiful tiles and medicine cabinets.
        
        With more than 70,000 square feet of outdoor space, 41 unique amenities, and a concierge service to handle all your needs, you may never have to leave the building. Work from home? If not, you may be tempted to start! The Rheingold includes a business center, conference rooms, laundry room, creative studios, fitness center and cafeteria. Grab a cup of coffee on your way to work or snack on a croissant as you work from the comfort of your urban oasis. Enjoy four seasons of New York weather in one of the large, landscaped outdoor spaces. Trees, flowers and fountains provide the backdrop on the lower courtyards. Excellent views of Manhattan, ample lounge space and waterfalls provide a zen factor on the common roof deck. Test your fear of heights on the rooftop sky-bridge or on the climbing wall in the fitness center. Your four-legged friends want to join in the fun? Bring them to the dog run or pet spa. Love to entertain? The building offers many areas that can be reserved for private events or parties including music, photo and painting studios, movie screening room and private roof party area.
        
        Home to some of Brooklyn's best new restaurants, bars and nightlife, Bushwick offers all of the conveniences that NYC has to offer, right at your fingertips. You won't have to go far for nightly entertainment, Bushwick is home to unrivaled arts, theater and music scenes, many located in former warehouses, a reminder of the neighborhood's industrial past.
        
        Getting around Brooklyn or into Manhattan is a breeze with the variety of convenient transportation options. Ditch those L train blues with the J/M/Z trains just minutes away at the Myrtle Avenue station. The L train at Morgan Avenue is less than half mile away, the B57 bus stop is right around the corner and there is a Citi Bike station just a few blocks away."},
