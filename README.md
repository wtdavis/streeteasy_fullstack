## EliteEasy: a fullstack StreetEasy.com clone

###Introduction
This project aims to faithfully re-create the StreetEasy site, made for searching and advertising property to rent or sell in New York City. StreetEasy has approachable styling and functionality; I chose to clone it to expand my skills while maintaining achievable goals, and because, having used the site and enjoyed my experience, I wanted to learn more about how to create something useable but simple. Technologies involved in this project include:
 - Languages: HTML/CSS, Ruby, Javascript
 - Frontend: React/Redux
 - Backend: Ruby on Rails
 - Database: PostgresQL
 - Hosting: Render
 - Services: AWS cloud storage
